# Student Gradebook – Console Application

**Name:** Betty Phipps  
**Assignment:** Student Gradebook – Assignment 1  

## 📘 Description
This project is a simple Java console application that simulates a gradebook for a single student.  
It demonstrates the use of:
- Classes and objects  
- Methods (setters, calculations, string formatting)  
- User input/output with the `Scanner` class  
- Basic arithmetic and conditional logic  

The application prompts the user to enter a students information and test scores, calculates the average score, assigns a letter grade, and displays a formatted student report.
