# Student Gradebook – Console Application

**Name:** Betty Phipps  
**Assignment:** Student Gradebook – Assignment 1  

## Description
This project is a simple Java console application that simulates a gradebook for a single student.  

It demonstrates:
- Classes and objects  
- Methods (setters, calculations, string formatting)  
- User input/output with the Scanner class  
- Basic arithmetic and conditional logic  

The application prompts the user to enter a students information and test scores, calculates the average score, assigns a letter grade, and displays a formatted student report.

## Files
- **Student.java** Defines the Student class with fields, setters, and methods for average, grade, and report.  
- **StudentGradebookApp.java** Contains the main() method to prompt the user for input and display the report.  
- **README.md** Documentation and instructions.
